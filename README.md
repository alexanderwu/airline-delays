# Predicting Airline Delays

In this project, we use PySpark to build models to predict whether flight will be delayed. This is our final project from the "PSTAT 194 - Spark Programming" class offered at UC Santa Barbara.

## Getting Started

These are the files in our project:

* **PSTAT 194 Final Paper.pdf** is a report of our work
* **PSTAT 194 Final Project Presentation.pptx** is a PowerPoint presentation summarizing our work
* **PSTAT194_DataVisualizations.ipynb** is a Jupyter Notebook where we did our exploratory data analysis and identify useful variables for modeling.
* **PSTAT194 Preprocessing.ipynb** is a Jupyter Notebook where we transform our original data to a form that is ready for modeling
* **PSTAT194 Final Project.ipynb** is a Jupyter Notebook where we perform our modeling and analyze the results

## Steps for Reproducing

We did all our work with PySpark and Jupyter Notebooks. To reproduce these results, you will need to install PySpark and Jupyter Notebook. Additionally, you will need to download the data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/usdot/flight-delays/data). We did not include the dataset here because the dataset is very large.
